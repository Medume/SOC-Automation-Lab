<h1>MSCIA-Capstone</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The main goal of the capstone project was to make a significant impact on the security of the organization (NexusTech), even if it's a fictional one. The plan was to fortify the organization's defenses,  by proactively addressing new threats. This was done through risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, and threat monitoring to name a few. Through careful analysis, the aim was to enhance incident response strategies that would ensure quick and effective actions when facing cyber incidents. Ultimately, the goal was to create a safer digital environment, while protecting critical assets and data from future cyber attacks.

<h4>There are two parts to this project: Implementation & Evaluation</h4>

**1.** In the implementation phase, the focus is on putting the proposed solutions and strategies into action. This could involve the actual deployment of cybersecurity measures, tools, or protocols that were designed in the planning phase. Implementation may include:

* Deploying Security Measures: Putting in place the recommended security protocols, technologies, or best practices to address vulnerabilities and enhance cybersecurity.

* Testing and Validation: Conducting thorough testing to ensure that implemented measures work as intended and don't end up creating new issues.

* Monitoring and Fine-Tuning:  Putting in place procedures for ongoing observation to gauge how well solutions are being put into practice and making necessary corrections.

* Training and Awareness: Providing training to relevant personnel to ensure they are aware of the new security measures and understand their role in maintaining a secure environment.

**2.** After the implementation, the evaluation phase involves assessing the outcomes of the project. This includes:

* Effectiveness Assessment: Evaluating how well the implemented measures address the identified vulnerabilities and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture.

* Documentation: Gathering detailed information on the solutions that have been put into practice, their setups, and any modifications made during the execution stage.

* Lessons Learned: Reflecting on the project to identify lessons learned, challenges encountered, and areas for improvement. This information can be valuable for future assessments.

* Reporting and Presentation:  Using reports or presentations to inform stakeholders of the outcomes and conclusions. This step helps ensure transparency and allows stakeholders to understand the impact of the implemented cybersecurity measures.

The overall goal of these steps combined is to create a strategic cybersecurity strategy, evaluate its implementation, and assess its effectiveness. Below is a quick rundown of the project, highlighting the core parts of the whole process
